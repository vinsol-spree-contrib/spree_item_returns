## FEATURES

* Adds a tab for a user to keep track of all his/her return authorizations.
* Provides user an ability to create a return authorization against an order.

## Installation

1. Add this extension to your Gemfile with this line:

  #### Spree >= 3.2

  ```ruby
    gem 'spree_item_returns' , github: 'vinsol-spree-contrib/spree_item_returns'
  ```

  #### Spree < 3.2

  ```ruby
  gem 'spree_item_returns', github: 'vinsol-spree-contrib/spree_item_returns', branch: 'X-X-stable'
  ```

  The `branch` option is important: it must match the version of Spree you're using.
  For example, use `3-0-stable` if you're using Spree `3-0-stable` or any `3.0.x` version.

2. Install the gem using Bundler:
  ```shell
  bundle install
  ```

3. Copy & run migrations
  ```shell
  bundle exec rails g spree_item_returns:install

## Testing

  #### Spree >= 3.1

  For Building Dependencies:
  ```shell
  appraisal install
  ```

  The dummy app can be regenerated by using:
  ```shell
  appraisal spree-3-1 rake test_app

  ```
  This will run rake test_app using the dependencies configured for Spree 3.1. Similarly you can use spree-3-2 and spree-master for generating dummy applications using dependencies for Spree 3.2 and latest version of Spree


  ```shell
  appraisal spree-3-1 rspec
  ```
  This will run rspec using the dependencies configured for Spree 3.1. Similarly you can use spree-3-2 and spree-master to run rspec using dependencies for Spree 3.2 and latest version of Spree


  #### Spree 3.0 and Spree 2.x

  First bundle your dependencies, then run `rake`. `rake` will default to building the dummy app if it does not exist, then it will run specs. The dummy app can be regenerated by using `rake test_app`.

  ```shell
  bundle
  bundle exec rspec spec
  ```
